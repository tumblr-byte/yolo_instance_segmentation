# yolo_instance_segmentation
I performed YOLO instance segmentation on YOLOv8 using both a custom dataset and the COCO dataset, for both images and videos. This archive file, when unzipped, will give you a "butterfly" folder, which contains two subfolders: "train" and "test". Inside the "dataset.yaml" file, it specifies the locations of the training and test data and organizes the structure of the dataset. This includes paths to images, annotations, and any other necessary information for the model to learn from.

To get the custom dataset, you can refer to this tutorial video: How to Get a Custom Dataset for YOLOv8. This video provides a step-by-step guide to help you set up your own dataset for training with YOLOv8.
